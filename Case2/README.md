* log_ocean_expensive.txt
    log file contain instance 1~5 with (container capacity, container cost) = (0.5, 1500)
* data folder
    contain excel file of parameter of instance 1~5
* solution folder
    contain excel file of solution of instance 1~5
* algorithm_module.py
    heuristic algorithmn function (for question 3)
* check_valid.py
    function which check order is valid or not and it objective value
* CS2_graded_program.py
    main program to test heuristic function, output result ot "result.xlsx"
* q1.pdf
    document of model building of linear programming
* q2_main.py
    main program to run instance 1~5, store the answer in solution folder(for question 1,2)
* q2_ulti.py
    contain function to read excel file
* q2-instance-1.ipynb
    mainly use for testing, this is not a important file
